Heyo!

This code does the following yo,

1. Retreives parsed REGEX input  
2. Passes REGEX representation to nfa.rs which returns a NFA  
3. Passes NFA to dfa.rs which returns a DFA  
4. Passes DFA to min_dfa.rs which returns a MINDFA  
5. Outputs to `out.xml`  

It was written in Rust, but NOT in the Rust coding style (I am in pain)  
If you want to compile it from scratch, install a rust compiler ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ and execute the commands:
```bash
    cargo build                     //compiles
    cp ./target/debug/prac_one ./   //just copy the exe out of the folder Rust likes to put it within
    ./prac one "someinputstring"    //run it like an exe yo
```

The xml file is structured as follows: 
```xml
<mindfa>
    <states>
		<0>true</0> //accept val stored in state
    </states>
    <transitions>
		<0>
			<0>a</0> //transition from 0 to 0 on 'a' char
			<0>b</0>
		</0>
    </transitions>
</mindfa>
```
Is it buggy? Probably. Am I in tears? Yes.

Bye!
